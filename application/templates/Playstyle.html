						Lastly, it was observed in the playstyle category that the offline multiplayer gamers would have less anxiety through their results in the GAD which shows a higher density in the score range of 0 to 6. Offline multiplayer gamers also show the least social phobia with the majority of its score ranging between 0 to 26 and the maximum being 54 out of 68.  This is perhaps due to the players usually interacting with people who they personally know and physically see. It was also observed that singleplayer gamers show less social phobia as compared to online multiplayer gamers. Though online multiplayer gamers have nearly constant interaction with fellow gamers online, they may lack the social skill when interacting with others in real life thus resulting in social phobia.
