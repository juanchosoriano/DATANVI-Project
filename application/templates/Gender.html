						Gender is divided among three sub-groups: males, females and other. For the second question, gender is taken into account and it was observed that in the SPIN questionnaire, the male gender has a nearly equal density in all scores. 
						The female gender on the other hand, could be seen to have a less dense plot at scores 60 to 68. 
						This could indicate that girls could have less social anxiety in gaming.
